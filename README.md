# Simple-GAN
GANs are awesome!

This repository contains the .py files that illustrate the PyTorch implementation of basic GANs. generated_images directory contains the images that were generated with hyperparameters LR = 5e-4, BATCH_SIZE=32, EPOCHS=75.<br>
Note that GANs are _very_ sensitive to hyperparameters.
